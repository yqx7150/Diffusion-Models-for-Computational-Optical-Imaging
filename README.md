# Diffusion-Models-for-Computational-Optical-Imaging

As an emerging technology, computational optical imaging demonstrates remarkable advantages through its high degrees of freedom, high-dimensional information acquisition capability, and intelligent characteristics. 

The core challenge lies in achieving high-quality image reconstruction through inverse problem solving. 

While traditional regularization methods have improved reconstruction quality to some extent, their robustness and generalizability remain limited when handling complex imaging scenarios. 

Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising solution by learning data distributions to provide more universal and adaptive prior information, thereby enabling new possibilities for high-fidelity image reconstruction.

## Learning from Spatial Domain

The final output of computational optical imaging is typically represented in the spatial domain. 

Therefore, prior learning in this domain (including for grayscale images, color images, high-dimensional color images, and complex amplitude images), provides the most direct constraint generation method.
